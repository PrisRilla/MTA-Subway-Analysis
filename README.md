New Yorkers spend a significant amount of their lives riding the MTA. This project looks to analyze public MTA data to understand how New York's present day system operates and how ridership is affected by Covid-19.

## Data Source
Data is scraped from [MTA Website's Turnstile Data.](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)  
The focus of the analysis is to compare passenger behavior pre and post Covid-19 quarantine. For this purpose, we will examine 2020's turnstile data. Please note the following:
 - The first case of Covid-19 confirmed on 3/1/2020  
 - Closing of non-essential businesses was announced March 20, 2020

####  IRT vs. BMT vs. IND Lines  
Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit (BMT), and Independent Subway (IND) lines have a long history that you can [read about here](https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Subway_FAQ:_Which_Lines_Were_Former_IRT,_IND,_BMT#:~:text=The%20trains%20of%20the%20BMT,car%20to%20platform%20is%20unsafe.). In short, the city's IND took over bankrupt BMT and IRT companies June 1, 1940 and unified the transit systems into our modern day train system.
